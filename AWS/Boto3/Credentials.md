# Content from docs

The Quickstart guide provides instructions for installing Boto 3. You can also follow the instructions there to set up new credential files, or you can continue to use your existing Boto 2.x credentials. Please note that Boto 3, the AWS CLI, and several other SDKs all use the shared credentials file (usually at ~/.aws/credentials).

# Note

When you make IAM user, at the time of finishing, you can get download `credentials.csv` first as last at that time
That file will used to login AWS service via Boto3
