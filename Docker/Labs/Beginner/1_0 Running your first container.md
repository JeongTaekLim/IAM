### 1.2 Terminology
In the last section, you saw a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some. So before you go further, let's clarify some terminology that is used frequently in the Docker ecosystem.

* Images - The file system and configuration of our application which are used to create containers. To find out more about a Docker image, run docker inspect alpine. In the demo above, you used the docker pull command to download the alpine image. When you executed the command docker run hello-world, it also did a docker pull behind the scenes to download the hello-world image.
* Containers - Running instances of Docker images â€” containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers, and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS. You created a container using docker run which you did using the alpine image that you downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the docker ps command.
* Docker daemon - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers.
* Docker client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the Docker daemon.
* Docker Store - A registry of Docker images, where you can find trusted and enterprise ready containers, plugins, and Docker editions. You'll be using this later in this tutorial.
